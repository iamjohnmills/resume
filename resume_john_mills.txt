CURRENT
I'm currently developing next-generation experiences in the IT—Networking space at Allbridge. I'm responsible for the front-end of 3 SaaS apps which monitor and manage large-scale property networks, and connect thousands of hotel guests to wifi networks every day. I've built and shipped sophisticated tools to visualize complex data and connect hotel guests to wifi, including deep integrations with REST APIs to build engaging visualizations, table view datasets, and CRUD functionalities. I've created login pages, bandwidth visualizations, and various tools to manage network equipment via the UI of our apps. I'm a pragmatic, detail oriented engineer with an eye for design. I like readable, optimized code geared towards ease-of-maintenance within a team. Our apps are built with Vue and React where I am a core contributor to new features and lead on architecture, deployments, and dev team workflows. I recently started a React app to supplement our support and leadership teams with additional dashboards and tools to diagnose network issues at properties, manage users, and see at-a-glance aggregate datasets of bandwidth, and active devices. I am a technically-proficient, user-centric, holistic developer with a keen sense of how distributed systems work together.
